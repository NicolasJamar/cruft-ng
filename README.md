cruft-ng, a rewrite of Debian 'cruft' engine
============================================

Cruft is built as a main shell scripts that spawn
hundreds of helper processes (other shell scripts,
perl programs, C programs).

This project attempts to keep all the main functionality in one process;
while output remains 100% identical to cruft's one.

Here are some [benchmarks](https://github.com/a-detiste/cruft-ng/wiki/Benchmark).

This is written in C++, but it is mostly pure C + strings + vectors.

cruft-ng needs cruft ruleset:
-----------------------------

* `/usr/lib/cruft/explain/` : this is a set of shell/perl
  scripts, only the most CPU-intensive - `dpkg` - is ignored and replaced
  with native C++ code

* `/usr/lib/cruft/filters-unex/` : these are glob-like files,
  quite like, but not totally the same than in your
  standard shell. this re-uses cruft' `shellexp.c`

Some assumption differs:
------------------------

* We are not in 1998 anymore, this should not be a problem
  to keep 32 or 64mb of data in memory;
  so the intermediary spooling in `/var/spool/cruft/`
  is un-needed; unless it is processed by external tools

* Debian

* cruft-ng uses mlocate binary database instead of
  running 'find' on the whole file system,
  this way, it can also be setgid mlocate to be
  able to access the db and be run by any user;
  while cruft need to be run as root.

* cruft scan `/home` with find *twice*, only to detect
  files not owned by /home/$user & broken symlinks;
  cruft-ng never scan `/home`
  (cruft also give false positives for files
  created/deleted between the two 'find' runs)

TODO:
-----

 * command switches are currently not implemented

 * cruft-ng doesn't detect broken symlinks at this time;
   it's a different topic and should be split in a
   separate tool. (and this really needs 'find'
   and can't be done with mlocate db).
